<div class="header2">Contributing</div>
<div class="docs_text">	
	Outside of <a href="docs.php?page=gold">donating money</a> there are a few things you
	can do. Note that no contribution can confer any favoritism from [Redacted]Me Staff.
</div>
<div class="header2">Bug reports and fixes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you discover a bug or potential exploit you can report it. If you are able to code
	you can also submit a pull request at our <a href="https://github.com/Redacted-Games-LLC/Merchant-Empires">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>
<div class="header2">Images and Art</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	New artwork can be submitted via pull request. Include the image file and another text
	file containing the commercial license or public domain release. Name it like so:
</div>
<pre>
        replacedimage.png
        replacedimage.png.license
</pre>
<div class="docs_text">
	We'll favor pull requests which include adding your own line to the
	<a href="docs.php?page=credits">Credits</a> page to save us the extra step, if we decide
	to use your image.
</div>
<div class="header2">New Goods and Ships</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There are no goods and ships which come with the Merchant Empires open source release.
	Goods and ships are added by the game hosts to make their own ME unique.
</div>
<div class="header2">Suggestions without Contributions</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you are unable to create art or code you can try pitching your idea on the
	<a href="http://reddit.com/r/MerchantEmpires">subreddit</a> with the [Suggestion] tag to
	see if someone is willing to implement it for you.

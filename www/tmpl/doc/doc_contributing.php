<div class="header2">Contributing</div>
<div class="docs_text">	
	Outside of <a href="docs.php?page=gold">donating money</a> there are a few things you
	can do. Note that no contribution can confer any favoritism from [Redacted]Me Staff.
</div>
<div class="header2">Bug reports and fixes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you discover a bug or potential exploit you can report it. If you are able to code
	you can also submit a pull request.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There is a file in the source root called CODING.txt which should help with the
	standards.
</div>
<div class="header2">Images and Art</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	New artwork can be submitted via pull request. Include the image file and another text
	file containing the commercial license or public domain release. Name it like so:
</div>
<pre>
        replacedimage.png
        replacedimage.png.license
</pre>
<div class="docs_text">
	We'll favor pull requests which include adding your own line to the
	<a href="docs.php?page=credits">Credits</a> page to save us the extra step, if we decide
	to use your image.
</div>
<div class="header2">New Goods</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Aside from the image pull request requirements above, include <em>everything</em> which
	would need to change to integrate your good. Include upgrade paths, planetary random start
	supply/demand levels, tech associations or whatever. Depending on how complex the good is
	it may not make it in until the new round.
</div>
<div class="header2">Suggestions without Contributions</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you are unable to create art or code you can try pitching your idea on the
	<a href="http://reddit.com/r/MerchantEmpires">subreddit</a> with the [Suggestion] tag to
	see if someone is willing to implement it for you. I won't, as I must focus my attention
	on the <a href="docs.php?page=roadmap">roadmap</a>.

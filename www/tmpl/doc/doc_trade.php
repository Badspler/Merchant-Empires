	Trade
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Trade involves buying goods from one place and selling them to another. Most trade
	will occur between <strong>Ports</strong> but there are also goods available at
	some <a href="docs.php?page=dealers">Dealers</a>.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The common currency of the galaxy is the <em>credit</em> using the symbol
	<strong>¢</strong> (alt code 0162) and the icon
	<img src="res/credits.png" width="14" height="14" title="Credits Icon" alt="¢" /> 
</div>
<div class="header3">
	Taxes
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Goods you purchase may be taxed. Each <a href="docs.php?page=race">race</a> has a
	different tax rate with the Xollians standing out as having theirs set at 0%.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you trade at ports owned by your own race you will pay only one tax. Trading at
	ports owned by other races will also cost you the enemy tax rate.
</div>
<div class="header3">
	Inflation
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	All prices in the galaxy are modified by inflation. Inflation accumulates from the
	start of the round at a rate of about 3% per day. After about a month of play prices
	will be twice as high as when the round began, so avoid stockpiling credits.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The top-right corner of every page has an inflation indicator along
	with a page build. It looks like the following:
</div>
<div class="docs_image">
	<img src="res/doc/page_build.png" alt="Example of Inflation/Page Build" title="Inflation/Page Build" />
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You must plan for residual inflation when using Dealers, carry a bit
	of extra credits in case the inflation shifts the price a bit while you
	are browsing the stock.

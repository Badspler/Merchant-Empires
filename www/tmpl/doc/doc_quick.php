<div class="header2">Quick Start Guide</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you just want to get going then here is a quick start sheet for you. Once
	you get your turns burned down to 1000 go ahead and come for the rest of the
	manual. Make sure you are in a safe location though!
</div>
<div class="header3">Browser Stuff</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	This is a web browser game, so you play by clicking links. The server will
	process your request and update your viewport. You don't need any plugins
	or downloads, just a modern browser. For nostalgia the old click, process, redirect is intended and you might
	get funky results if you use the back button.
</div>
<div class="header3">Joining a Game</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	After signing up you can link up to 4 players with your account. How many
	players you run will depend on the life commitments you have, but to start
	out just make one, picking a name and <a href="docs.php?page=races">race</a>.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You will spawn in an escape pod with no scanner or access to ports. You must
	click on the sector numbers above the green arrow to navigate to a ship
	dealer and get your first starter ship. 
</div>
<div class="header4">Viewport</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Once you are in a real ship your viewport will come alive.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<strong>The Radar:</strong> The green, spinning radar on the right side
	of the viewport shows you whether or not there is hostile forces in the
	adjacent sector. Check your radar before moving, refresh if necessary.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<strong>Nav Controls:</strong> The navigation panel on the left side of
	the viewport can be clicked to move to another sector. You already know
	to look at the scanner for hostile (red) forces right? 
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<img src="res/government_scan.png" />Green stars mean safety! When you
	move, make sure the sector has a green star in it and you can't be
	attacked. Some players make a great living never leaving these zones!
</div>
<div class="header3">Making Money</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Now fly around to different planets inside the protected perimeter. 
	Click on the <a href="docs.php?page=ports">port</a>, they buy and
	sell goods with an indicator of how far to the nearest places to
	send or receive them. You may wish to scout out the destination to
	make sure it is a safe place before starting a trade route.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Have fun! Remember this game is grindy by nature.

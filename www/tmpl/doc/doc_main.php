	Welcome to Merchant Empires
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The nostalgia lives on! I played Advanced Powers Merchant Empires for a few years and
	worked with the development team. I wasn't the greatest asset to the team, but I did
	enjoy what I was doing for the time. Here is my attempt at revitalizing that wonderful
	browser game and releasing it as open source just as Bryan Brunton wanted it to be.

<div class="docs_text">
	New players to [Redacted]ME head over to the <a href="docs.php?page=quick">Quick Start</a>
	guide. Then enjoy!
